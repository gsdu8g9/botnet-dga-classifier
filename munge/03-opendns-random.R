# The OpenDNS Random Sample List is a random sample of 10,000 domain names. Similar to the OpenDNS 
# Top Domains List, domains that we flagged as suspicious are not present in the list, that can be 
# used as a benign data set.
# 
# Both lists are in public domain, available on Github, and are automatically updated weekly.
# They are not meant to replace other public lists in any way. The Top Domains List, in particular, 
# is solely based on DNS queries and doesnâ€™t reflect the popularity of websites.
