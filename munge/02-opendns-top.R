#
# The OpenDNS Top Domains List is the top 10,000 domain names our resolvers all over the globe 
# are receiving queries for, sorted by popularity. The popularity is defined as the number of 
# unique client IPs having looked up a domain over a 1 hour period. Domain names that we flagged 
# as being used to serve or control malware are removed from the list.
# 
# Both lists are in public domain, available on Github, and are automatically updated weekly.
# They are not meant to replace other public lists in any way. The Top Domains List, in particular, 
# is solely based on DNS queries and doesnâ€™t reflect the popularity of websites.
