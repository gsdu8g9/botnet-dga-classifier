### Classification

A rough pass at classifying domains as either legit or malicious based on the current feature set.  A portion of the data is held-out at random for cross-validation.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
model <- train_classifier (type ~ length + dictionary, domains, p = 0.80)
```

```{r}
model
```

How accurate is the classifier?

```{r}
summary (model)
```

Are there any issues with either sensitivity or specificity?

```{r}
confusionMatrix (model)
```

### Real-World Classification

When such a model is applied in the real-world, the more challenging scenario is when a completely new malware implementation is encountered.  In this scenario there is no training data specific to the new maleware. The following assesses accuracy based on this more difficult scenario.

Step 1: Create a training data set using Goz and Cryptolocker.

```{r}
trainer <- domains [ source %in% c ("goz",
                                    "cryptolocker",
                                    "opendns-random-10k",
                                    "opendns-top-10k")]
```

Step 2: Train a model using **all** of the training data available from Goz and Cryptolocker.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
model <- train_classifier (type ~ length + dictionary, trainer, p = 1.0, n = 10)
```

```{r}
model
```

Step 3: Create a hold-out test data set as if Newgoz has never been encountered and is new in the wild.  Also, use a completely different set of 'legit' domains from Alexis.

```{r}
tester <- domains [ source %in% c ("newgoz", "alexa")]
```

Step 4: Use the classification model to classify the held-out test data.

```{r}
tester$type.hat <- predict (model, newdata = tester)
```

Step 5: How accurate is the domain classification?

```{r}
with (tester, confusionMatrix (type, type.hat, positive = "malicious"))
```
